# Predict_H1N1_Seasonal-flu_vaccine

Goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and Seasonal flu vaccines

1. Introduction

  1.1 Purpose 
  
    This information describes rules for predicting the need for H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines. The
    system uses data on population size, global epidemics, and vaccination records to estimate vaccination 
    rates for various groups. 

  1.2 Scope 
    
    The project includes: 
    a. Data collection: Collecting past vaccination records, demographic information, and medical records.
    b. Feature mining: Extracting key features such as age, gender, ethnicity, and vaccination status. 
    c. Model Development: Implementation of H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccine Prediction Models. 
    d. Focus: Integrating predictive tools into health systems to create insurance plans and distribute    
    benefits. 

  1.3 Terminology, Abbreviations, and Symbols 
    
    a. H1N1: Subtype H1N1 of the influenza A virus, also known as swine flu. 
    b. ML: Machine Learning. 
    c. Seasonal Flu: Flu occurs every year due to different strains of the virus. 
  
2. General Description

  2.1 Product-Based

     These predictive models can be integrated into broader treatment planning strategies to help decision
     makers effectively allocate vaccine resources and understand which organizations are at risk.

  2.2 Product Features

     a. Data Collection:
        Collect demographic information (age, gender, location).
        Collect information about vaccines outside of the flu season.
        Assess health status, complications, and risk factors for H1N1.

     b. Preliminary information:
        Clean and normalize data Consider cases where there are no significant differences or outliers.
        Create baseline targets, including vaccination scores.

     c. Training model:
        Train a training model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, neural network).
        Evaluate model performance using precision, accuracy, and recall.

     d. Standard metrics:
        Check accuracy using previous data.
        Use metrics like F1 score, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix.

     e. Export:
        Provide predictions in customer dashboards.
        Enable API integration for healthcare systems.
     
  2.3 User Features

     a. Physician: Learn about the key organizations involved in immunization.

     b. Public Health Officer: Responsible for distributing benefits and making insurance decisions.

     c. Data Analyst: Review output predictions and improve parameters.
     
3. Special Requirements

  3.1 External Interface Required

     a. User Interface: Dynamic dashboard displaying vaccine trends and forecasts.

     b. Hardware Interface: Suitable for cloud systems and healthcare servers.

     c. Software Interface: Integrates with existing EHR (Electronic Health Record) systems.

  3.2 Operational Conditions

     a. Data Collection: Data was collected from electronic health records and public health records. Regular
       updates are possible through API integration.

     b. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Vaccination coverage was determined using statistical methods.
       Stratified risk profiles for the target were created.

     c. Model Training and Forecasting: Train predictive models using historical and demographic data.
       Streamline the response to influenza viruses.

     d. Comments: Provide clear graphs showing vaccination rates by demographic group. Provide regional
       competition and evaluate reliability metrics.
   
  3.3 Design Constraints

     a. Scalability: Need to manage indefinite data growth during the next flu season.

     b. Performance: Real-time predictions are required.

     c. Security: Comply with health information privacy regulations such as HIPAA.
      
4. Establish boundaries
      
     - A high-performance system must process large amounts of data within a reasonable amount of time to
     make immediate decisions.
     - Scalability Expand the program to new groups and geographies as needed.
     - Security We use access controls and data protection to protect patient privacy.

5. Additional Information

     - Accuracy: The estimated accuracy level for vaccination coverage should be greater than 90%.
     
     - Precision: Reduce the risk that vaccination coverage estimates are inaccurate.
     
     - Reminder: Use high precision to identify all at-risk individuals.
     
     - F1 Score: Balances recall and precision for best results.

6. Testing and Certification
     
     - Block Evaluation: Identify individual locations (e.g., prediction models, purchasing processes).
     
     - Integration Testing: Verify that priorities, learning models, and dashboards work together seamlessly.
     
     - Functional Testing: Accurately assesses the overall functioning of the body.
     
     - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Test accuracy and usability with clinicians.

7. Results
     
     - Prediction Model: The model is trained to predict seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccines.
     
     - Data Pipeline: Used to collect, clean, and process input data.
     
     - Dashboard: A user interface that displays metrics and remediation recommendations.
     
     - Documentation: Detailed information and user manuals.
